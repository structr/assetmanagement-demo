  "description": "\u0027Elimination of the hazard is rarely an option given the utility/amenity involved. Minimizing the risk is non-trivial with fundamentally hazardous substances such as electricity. Duty of care is demonstrated when all reasonably practicable precautions have been taken. What is reasonably practicable includes a measure of the significance of the risk versus the effort required to reduce it. The risk that is assessed in this process includes the risk imposed on any individual (commonly determined for the maximally exposed, reasonably behaved individual) and for the risk imposed on society (commonly determined for multiple fatality risk for a single event). For further guidance on risk management see AS/NZS ISO 31000.Nominal risk targets for hazards in HV installations, even those within levels recognized by the international safety industry as being \u0027safe\u0027 may not be sufficient to meet a duty of care obligation. It is, however, reasonable that all known and commonly applied precautions have been assessed, and applied so far as is reasonably practicable (SFAIRP) or as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) where the cost/risk reduction is not grossly disproportionate. A risk target below the assessed mean risk for all other hazards across all asset classes of the enterprise could also be used to help decide when seeking further precautions for a particular hazard will no longer be required.High voltage installations require a detailed quantitative risk assessment, based on industry or enterprise data including previous assessments. Realistic estimates of the associated cost increments are required to ensure the decision to not use a risk treatment, where the cost is disproportionate to the risk reduction, is soundly based.\u0027",

Heat sources include but are not limited to the following:(a) Power transformers.(b) Instrument transformers.(c) Capacitors.(d) Circuit breakers.(e) Oil filled cables.(f) Cable sheaths.(g) Emergency diesel generators.Every high voltage installation has a potential fire risk zone that extends in every direction, from its perimeter. If any part of the fire risk zone extends to include other buildings, parts of the same building that house the high voltage installation, fire escape routes, or other fire sensitive locations and facilities, then a potentially high fire hazard exists. Consideration of the area surrounding the installation should also be included, in particular the effect of fire on or from surrounding vegetation.Openings should be provided in high voltage installation enclosures for appropriate ventilation and pressure relief for gaseous products. Ventilation is required to assist air circulation and help cool transformers. Transformer enclosure natural ventilation provisions can be designed to also satisfy pressure relief requirements.For roofed enclosures housing HV switchgear only, specific arrangements need to be made for pressure relief in the absence of adequate ventilation openings. Alternatively, the enclosure shall be designed for the calculated internal pressure rise.Consideration should be given to segmenting the high voltage installation with fire-resistant barriers, for security of supply, safety of personnel and to facilitate fire fighting.",

The FRA should consider the following:(a) The subdivision of the plant to prevent the spread of fire, protect personnel and to limit the consequential damage (provision of appropriate redundancy/security). Methods may include the provision of physical separation or barriers.(b) The control or elimination of ignition sources.(c) The detection and suppression of fires.(d) Protection of adjacent property.(e) Protection of public in the vicinity of HV installations against fire and explosion.Guidance  on  fire  safety  practices  is  available  in  CIGRE  Technical  Brochure  No 537, IEEE Std 979 and ENA Doc 018.A fire risk control strategy should be developed for each installation as they are all subtly different in physical construction and operational requirements.

It should also be noted that whilst insulating liquid containment may not be required for all high voltage installations from a fire and general hazard management perspective other than as required by AS 1940 and above, it may be required by local environmental regulatory requirements.Where multiple transformers are arranged in banks consideration should be given to their separation by a fire barrier which may also be designed to withstand impact and blast forces in addition to its fire resistance. Transformers insulated with either less-combustible or combustible liquids should have a firewall between them for additional protection if the separation distance specified in Clauses 6.7.4 and 6.7.5 is not met or other requirements are determined for large installations in accordance with a risk management process. These walls should be a minimum of 300 mm higher than the highest oil-containing component of either transformer, and extend 300 mm horizontally beyond any transformer component that could be pressurized as a result of an electrical fault (see Figure 6.1).",

  "description": "To minimize the risks associated with a transformer fire, the following steps should be followed:(a) Minimize the risk of a fire starting.The transformer specification should consider insulation levels, operating temperatures, cooling systems, protection systems, operation (including the effect of prolonged overloading) and maintenance practices.(b) Minimize the risk of transformer failure developing into an oil fire.Consideration should be given to insulating liquids type, tank strength, low explosion risk bushings, and pressure relief.(c) Minimize  the  impact  of  a  transformer  fire  on  the  environment,  other  assets,  and humans.Consideration should be given to; fire segregation, oil containment systems, access for fire fighting, fire suppression systems and adjacent equipment and buildings.Guidance on transformer fire safety practices is available in the CIGRE Brochure No 537.",

  "description": "When a transformer failure has developed into a transformer fire, the transformer is in most cases destroyed beyond economic repair. Therefore, the control measures shall minimize the damage resulting from the fire, generally in the following order of priorities:(a) Minimize risk of loss of life and injury to humans byâ€”(i) providing adequate clearance around transformers particularly those with sound enclosures;(ii) providing adequate access for fire fighting equipment; and(iii) providing adequate egress routes.(b) Minimize the risk of the fire spreading or causing damage to adjacent transformers, control building, structures and other items of plant and equipment. These items may be critical for maintaining supply during a transformer fire or for restoring supply quickly after a transformer fire if supply cannot be maintained during the fire. Fire damage can be minimized byâ€”(i) providing passive protection systems in the form of; adequate separation distances, fire barriers, constructing buildings of fire resisting materials. For more information see the following clauses; and(ii) providing active suppression systems such as deluge, water mist, or gas flooding.(c) Minimize  contamination  and  damage  to  the  environment  by  provision  of  oil containment systems, bunding.(d) Minimize overall economic loss.",

In the former case, a manually controlled normally-closed valve shall be provided; in the latter case, the pump shall be manually controlled.(e) The design capacity of any drainage system shall be at least the rate of supply of emergency water within the compound as provided in Appendix I.NOTE: Drains  should  have  liquid  seals  where  appropriate  to  prevent  the  spread  of  fire through a drainage system.(f) A tank or compound used for the retention of spillage, with or without water, shall be constructed and located in a similar manner to the tanks and compounds used for storage. Such a compound shall comply with Clause 5.8.3(i).NOTE: Several compounds may be drained into a single retention compound.",
