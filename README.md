## Requirements

A running instance of Structr enterprise edition (> version 4.2.x)

## Installation

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts?highlight=Deployment%20Import#deployment-import) to import the application into your running Structr installation. 

Or follow these steps:
  - Go to the Dashboard section in the Structr UI and select the "Deployment" tab.
  - Copy the link URL of the latest release .zip file from this repository.
  - Paste the link into the input field "Download URL of ZIP file for app import".
  - Enter "assetmanagement-demo-1.0/webapp" in the field below.
