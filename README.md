# Structr Assetmanagement Demo

This is a small demo application build with Structr that showcases an assetmanagement usecase.

## Requirement

- A running instance of Structr (> version 4.2.0)
- A valid Structr license key

## Installation

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.structr.com/docs/fundamental-concepts?highlight=Deployment%20Import#deployment-import) to import the application into your running Structr installation. 

The easiest way is to copy the path of the realase zip file of this demo and paste the URL in the Structr dashboard/Deployment tab in the input file under "Import application from URL or upload a ZIP file" and click on the import button.

> :warning: **The deployment import will remove all existing application information in the Structr instance**: It is highly recommended to use a new and empty database for the deployment of this demo!
